Thank you for using the UC Berkeley BLB Specializer. For more information on this 
specializer and the ASP project, please visit http://www.sejits.org. This document
describes the basic steps neccessary to install and use the UC Berkeley BLB
Specializer. For information on using this specializer, please see 
https://github.com/davidhoward/BLB/wiki/Home .

1. Prerequisites
2. Installation and Setup
3. Verifying your installation
4. Running your first specialized program

1. PREREQUISITES

    The UC Berkeley BLB Specializer relies upon several other software packages in order
to function. Please verify that these are installed and working correctly on your machine
before attempting to install this specializer.

0) A Unix based operating system
    See sejits.org for information about using ASP on a non unix-y platform.

i) Python 2.6.x
    ASP SEJITS is designed to work with the 2.6 series of python releases. This specializer
and the libraries it relies upon may not function with other versions of python. See
http://www.python.org for information and to download python.

ii) The ASP Framework
    This package contains functions common to all ASP specializers, and is needed by this 
specializer to function. See sejits.org for information on installing the ASP framework.

iii) Gnu Scientific Library
    The Gnu Scientific Library may or may not be used for certain specialized operations,
but is necessary for the specializer to function properly. This specializer was tested against
GSL 1.15. For information and to get GSL, please visit http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl.

2. INSTALLATION AND SETUP

    Preparing the UC Berkeley BLB Specializer for use involves three steps: Acquiring the source
files, altering the appropriate environment variables, and writing the configuration files.

ACQUIRING THE SOURCE 

The most recent relase build of this specializer is available at 
https://github.com/shoaibkamil/asp/tree/master/specializers/BLB

This is a git repository, and may be clones as such.

SETTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

For easy use of this specializer, please ensure that the directory containing the compiled GSL
binary is on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and that the root directory of your specializer installation
(the one containing this document) is on your PYTHONPATH.

WRITING THE CONFIGURATION FILE

The UC Berkeley BLB Specializer requires some information about your sustem to function properly.
You should createa file in your root BLB directory named blb_setup.py with the following contents:

- gslroot = "/path/to/gsl/header_files"
  The specializer needs to know where to find the gsl header files.
- cache_dir = "/path/to/cgen/cache"
  The specializer caches modules it has already compiled in this directory, so that it does
  not have to re-compile for cases it has already seen.

An example of a properly formatted blb_setup.py is located in blb_setup_EXAMPLE.txt.
